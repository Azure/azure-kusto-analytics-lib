# Azure Data Explorer Library

This repository contains user functions, sample queries & notebookes for Azure Data Exlorer (Kusto). See the complete [index](.\index.md) of contents.

The 'Samples' database on the 'Help' cluster contains the tables required to test these sample queries; you can easily connect to it using #connect cluster('help').database('Samples')

However, in order to store functions you need to have write permission for the specific database; alternatively, you can use the inline (lambda) version.
